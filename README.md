### What is this repository for? ###

* This was done for a development position i recently applied for.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Load the Server and Web solutions in Visual Studio 2015, set the web project as the startup project in the web solution.  Run the server solution first then the web solution.  The server url is in the web solution web.config.  The app will ask you for your name, enter your name and you can start chatting.  Open a new window to the same address to add users.
