# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is both of my Skarpline Development Position Projects

### How do I get set up? ###

* Load the Server and Web solutions in Visual Studio 2015, set the web project as the startup project in the web solution.  Run the server solution first then the web solution.  The server url is in the web solution web.config.  The app will ask you for your name, enter your name and you can start chatting.  Open a new window to the same address to add users.

* Load the RestSharpDeserilizationProject in Visual Studio 2015 and run the unit test or reference the class library in another project.
